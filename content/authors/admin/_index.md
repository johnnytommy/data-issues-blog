My name is Johnny Tommy and I've always wanted to make a data blog, so here I am finally doing it! I'm from Philadelphia, PA and currently live in Brooklyn, NY. I was the first Statistics major at Ursinus College and I now work at Endeavor in NYC, where I work to digitally enable our vast library of brands to maximize our company's potential. I specialize in marketing attribution, web analytics, and new business incubation. I love data science and I'm a strong believer that everyone should have a general understanding of how data behaves but it can be stressful trying to make sense of scientific reports or academic papers that don't feel interesting or relatable. I hope you enjoy this blog as we dive into the underlying data patterns of your favorite movies, tv, music, and anything else that I think will be interesting!

I want to personally thank every mentor that has helped me make it this far in my career. In particular, a shoutout to God, my parents and sister, Lisa Grossbauer, Peter Chi, Mary Pat Julias, David Kretch, Adam Banker, and Saaz Zaheer.
